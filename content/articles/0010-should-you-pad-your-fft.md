Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms [typically
operate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooleyâ€“Tukey_FFT_algorithm) by
recursively (though perhaps not literally using recursion in the code) breaking
down the input into prime-factor-length sub-problems. Thus, the overall speed of
the funciton depends on the largest prime factor, and prime inputs may be slow
because they can't be broken down at all.

But how much slower are these prime inputs? If they're much slower, we may want
to pad the input with zeros. This is generally okay, but depending on your
input may cause window-related artifacts in your output.

Here's a quick benchmark of a 1D complex FFT using `scipy.fft` (which I believe
uses [`pocketFFT`](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/mtr/pocketfft)). This shows the
minimum execution time of 10 runs for random (uniform) complex data up to input
length 2**16. Prime inputs are highlighted by the red dots.

My takeaways here are:

* FFT of primes is definitely slower, up to ~5x (eyeballing it from the graph)
* Still, FFT is generally very fast even for large inputs
* Remember padding the input to avoid primes will also take some time (and
  memory) and may introduce window artifacts (though not padding doesn't
  guarantee absence of artifacts)
* As always, benchmark your specific application to see if this is meaningful
  (e.g. if you're doing an N-D FFT or calling it in a tight loop)
