I'm a software engineer with a background in medical imaging, and I currently
work at Hyperfine_--a medical device startup in Connecticut. I use Python for
scientific and general programming at work, and hobby programming on the side.
I (not-so) recently shipped my first iOS app, written in Swift. More recently,
I have been learning about Rust and getting back to graphics programming, which
I had not done since graduate school.

In my free time I ride bicycles on all kinds of terrain, and spend time cooking
and chilling with my family.
