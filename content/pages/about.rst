I'm an MRI clinical scientist currently living in Rochester, MN. I use Python
for scientific programming at work, and hobby programming on the side. I
recently shipped my first iOS app, written in Swift.

In my free time I ride bicycles on all kinds of terrain, and spend time cooking
and chilling with my family.
