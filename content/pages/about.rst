:summary: I ride bikes and spin protons

I'm a software engineer with a background in medical imaging, and I currently
work at Hyperfine - a medical device startup in Connecticut. I use Python for
scientific programming at work, and hobby programming on the side. I recently
shipped my first iOS app, written in Swift.

In my free time I ride bicycles on all kinds of terrain, and spend time cooking
and chilling with my family.
