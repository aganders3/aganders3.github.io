I'm a software engineer with a background in medical imaging, and I currently
work at CZI_ on open source for science. I favor Python and Rust for scientific
and general programming at work, and hobby programming on the side.

In my free time I enjoy cooking and hiking with my family, bicycling on all
kinds of terrain, and playing guitar and piano (rather poorly).
