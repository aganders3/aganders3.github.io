Forecheck
---------

*An iOS app for creating resusable checklists*

<img class="align-left" width="30%" src="/images/projects/ForecheckIcon_masked.png" alt="Forecheck app icon"/>

Use Forecheck to create and re-use checklists for workflows, chores,
packing lists, and any other repeated processes you need to manage.
Checklists help ensure task completeness and eliminate oversights.
Forecheck is built to be minimal yet flexible, with a simple interface
designed to do one thing well.

Forecheck was developed on nights and weekends in winter 2017/2018. It
is my first complete iOS App.

**Privacy Policy** Forecheck does not collect or store any user data.
Apple does collect and report to me some anonymized usage statistics.
This may change in future versions of Forecheck. If it does, this
privacy policy will be updated accordingly, and it will be noted in the
update notes.

GPI
---

*A Graphical Programming Interface for image processing and scientific
programming* [www.gpilab.com](http://www.gpilab.com)

GPI was developed by Nick Zwart to support MRI research for the Magnetic
Resonance Technology Design Group at the Barrow Neurological Institute
in Phoenix, AZ. I joined this group as a post-doc in 2014, eventually
becoming a Research Assistant Professor. I moved on from this position
in 2017, but I still use and maintain GPI in a smaller capacity.
