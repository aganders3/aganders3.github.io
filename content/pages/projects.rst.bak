Use ForeCheck to create and re-use checklists for workflows, chores, packing
lists, and any other repeated processes you need to manage. Checklists help
ensure task completeness and eliminate oversights. ForeCheck is built to be
minimal yet flexible, with a simple interface designed to do one thing well.

ForeCheck was developed on nights and weekends in winter 2017/2018. It is my
first complete iOS App.

**Privacy Policy**
ForeCheck does not collect or store any user data. Apple does collect and
report to me some anonymized usage statistics.
This may change in future versions of ForeCheck. If it does, this privacy policy
will be updated accordingly, and it will be noted in the update notes.

GPI
---
*A Graphical Programming Interface for image processing and scientific programming*
`www.gpilab.com <http://www.gpilab.com>`_

GPI was developed by Nick Zwart to support MRI research for the Magnetic
Resonance Technology Design Group at the Barrow Neurological Institute in
Phoenix, AZ. I joined this group as a post-doc in 2014, eventually becoming a
Research Assistant Professor. I moved on from this position in 2017, but I
still use and maintain GPI in a smaller capacity.
